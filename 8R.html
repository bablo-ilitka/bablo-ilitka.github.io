This lesson builds on students’ knowledge of multiplication and how to represent multiplication in arrays , equal rows and columns. Students build arrays to when starting to solve multiplication problems prior to memorizing their facts. In this lesson students will learn how to break apart. Their arrays showed 2 x 7 and 1 x 7 for a total of 21. Next, I had the students break apart the second number into 3 x 4 and 3 x 3 for a total of 21. To show why they should not break apart both numbers, I had the students show me an array were they broke the 3 apart into 2 and 1, and they broke the 7 part into 4 and 3. Their array showed 2 x 4. Lesson Plan for Grade 3 Chapter 4 Lesson 4 Students will use the Distributive Property to find products by breaking apart arrays . CC.3.OA.3: Use multiplication and division within 100 to solve word problems in situations involving equal groups, arrays , and measurement quantities, e.g., by. Big Ideas: Factors can be broken apart into smaller parts ( distributive property ) in order to get the same product by adding the two smaller products together. This lesson continues to build on students’ knowledge of multiplication and how to represent multiplication in arrays , equal rows and columns. Students build arrays when starting to solve multiplication problems prior to memorizing their facts. In the previous lesson students learned how to break apart. Explain, "The distributive property of multiplication lets you multiply a sum by multiplying each addend separately."; Write the definition on the board for student reference. Remind students that when we multiply, we can decompose ( break apart ) a factor into smaller parts to make it easier to multiply.; Give an example, like 7 x 12.Explain that with the distributive property , we can. 24.10.2016  ·  Breaking Apart Arrays for the Distributive Property of Multiplication. You would think that breaking apart an array is an easy step. Not really. Arrays can be broken apart in many ways: vertically or horizontally. But is there a way to break apart an array to make the process more efficient or easier? YES! One thing I do with students is practice breaking apart arrays at. Breaking apart arrays is another effective strategy for students who are learning multiplication, and helps model distributive property . For example: students usually learn their twos and their fives sooner than the larger times tables, so that when faced with a problem like 6 X 7, students can instead look at the 7 as a (5+2) instead. Like this: 6 X (5+2) OR (6 X 2) + (6 X 5) = 12 + 30 = 42.

The <b>distributive</b> <b>property</b> is a great tool to help with mental math and simplifying larger multiplication problems. Remind students that when we multiply, we can decompose (<b>break apart</b>) a factor into smaller parts to make it easier to multiply. Give an example, like 7 x 12. Explain that with the <b>distributive property</b>, we can decompose one of the factors and multiply by each part. Write the expression 7 x (10 + 2). Explain that 12 can be decomposed into numbers that are easier to multiply, like 10 and 2.
